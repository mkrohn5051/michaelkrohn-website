                <h2>Beam Focusing with Rayleigh Sommerfeld Method</h2>

                <h3>Methodology and Results</h3>
                <p>The first challenge was taking an unfocused beam and using the numerical Rayleigh Sommerfeld method to focus it. This classic circular piston problem used a specified radius of 1 cm, mimicking a cardiac phased array probe. The objective was to plot the continuous wave beam at 1 MHz out to 12 cm in water, then repeat the exercise for a focus at 5 cm.</p>

                <div class="technical-note">
                    <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                    <p>With deep gratitude, the partial solution was shown in concept without giving away the implementation details. The solution relied on 9th grade geometry principles applied to complex acoustic wave propagation.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Here are the initial results before optimization. The unfocused beam is on the left and the focused beam is on the right:</p>

                <div class="image-pair">
                    <img src="images/past-projects/r1_left.avif" alt="Initial unfocused beam attempt">
                    <img src="images/past-projects/r1_right.avif" alt="Initial focused beam attempt">
                </div>
                <p class="image-caption">Initial attempts - the results didn't feel good and looked about as good as they felt</p>

                <p>The initial results were problematic - the axis labels were wrong and the focusing wasn't working properly. After coffee and more careful MATLAB work, the results improved significantly:</p>

                <img src="images/past-projects/r2_left.avif" alt="Corrected beam focusing results" class="project-image">
                <p class="image-caption">Improved results showing clear beam convergence at 0.04 m - much better!</p>

                <p>This problem was particularly satisfying because the results are quite visible. A clear convergence can be seen at 0.04 m, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Rayleigh Sommerfeld numerical method for beam focusing calculations.</p>

                <h2>Complex Analytic Signal Processing</h2>

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>The next challenge involved finding the magnitude of the complex analytic signal from both simulated and real RF waveforms (A-scan, one dimensional). The process involved several key steps using MATLAB:</p>

                <div class="parameters">
                    <h4>Signal Processing Steps:</h4>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Find the FFT of the signal</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Zero FFT bits to produce the spectrum of analytic signal, using frequency cutoff to eliminate frequencies outside the passband</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Compute the IFFT of the analytic spectrum and double it to produce the complex analytic signal</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Take the magnitude of the complex analytic signal</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Plot the signal and the magnitude of the complex analytic signal together</p>

                    <h4>Double Bonus: Custom Filter Approach</h4>
                    <p>Low-pass Chebyshev2 and Butterworth filters were also tested for envelope detection. Results were less predictable, with filter parameters having significant impact on effectiveness. The filters followed the original signal peaks too closely, requiring more refinement.</p>

            <!-- Resolution Improvement -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Resolution Enhancement</h2>

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Given a pulse echo signal, the goal was to shorten the transmitted pulse length to achieve improved resolution, then determine what else could be changed without modifying the transducer to achieve a 2x improvement in resolution.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>The image below shows a summary of adjustments made to achieve optimum resolution. Note the progression from fuzzy, thick white bars to much cleaner, well-defined features:</p>

                <img src="images/past-projects/r7.avif" alt="Resolution improvement progression" class="project-image">
                <p class="image-caption">Resolution improvement progression: original (left), halved pulse length (center), optimized bandwidth (right)</p>

                <p>The left image shows the original pulse echo signal with characteristic fuzzy white bars across the middle. The center image was created with a halved transmit pulse length. The reason a full 2x improvement isn't seen is because only the transmit electrical pulse length was adjusted - this is only part of the resolution battle.</p>

                <p>The other major component is transducer bandwidth. When this is adjusted along with the halved electrical pulse, we achieve much closer to a 2x improvement in resolution. This can be practically achieved by adjusting the bandpass filter range to allow more signal through, though there are practical limits.</p>

                <div class="highlights">
                    <h3>Frequency Impact</h3>
                    <p>For the final part, transmit frequency increased from 5 MHz to 10 MHz. This seemingly simple change dramatically reframes the design problem:</p>
                    <p><strong>5 MHz crystal thickness:</strong> 0.154 mm</p>
                    <p><strong>10 MHz crystal thickness:</strong> 0.077 mm</p>
                    <p>This significant reduction impacts manufacturing cost, expertise requirements, breakage rates, and ultimately transducer pricing.</p>

                <h2>Delay and Sum Beamforming</h2>

                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>Echoes and their reflections, when delayed to be made "flat," then summed to show overall brightness level using the magnitude of the Hilbert transform, create an image! This is the fundamental principle behind ultrasound imaging.</p>

                <h3>Process and Results</h3>
                <p>Starting with echoes from targets at 1 and 2 cm respectively, the process involves time-aligning (flattening) the signals:</p>

                <p>The final step applies the magnitude of the Hilbert transform after summing all the aligned signals:</p>

                <h2>Contrast Analysis</h2>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Contrast is a rich subject with extensive applications in ultrasound imaging. At its core, contrast involves comparing adjacent regions' average peak values. While Speckle SNR, envelope variance, and envelope mean are all important parameters, the fundamental concept is the comparison of adjacent regions.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">Speckle region (left) and contrast region (right) used for contrast calculations</p>

                <p>To calculate Contrast for this image, we use: 20*log10(SpeckleMean/ContrastMean). Depending on the context, these regions may be swapped, but the calculated value provides the important quantitative measure of image contrast quality.</p>
